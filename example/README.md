# Presence example app

This is a really basic example of incorporating presence into a Vite React app.
The boilerplate in `/convex` is required to reexport the presence functionality
and disconnect handler. The main app is in `/src/App.tsx` which just
instantiates the Facepile react component from within the Presence Convex
component.

## Running the example

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
